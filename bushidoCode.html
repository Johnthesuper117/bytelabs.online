    <p>Bushidō (武士道, "the way of the warrior") is the code of conduct for the samurai class and has a few variations, not to be confused with Budō (武道) or Bujutsu (武術), which are the overall teaching of Martial arts and self improvement. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Origin of the Bushido and Samurai: 
    The term <i>'bushido'</i> first appeared as an unwritten moral code from the 12th century for the shogun. It wan't until the 16th century, in the Japanese military record Kōyō Gunkan, did the term <i>'bushido'</i> first appear. And since then, the Bushido code became more developed. Many of its ideas and influence came from Shinto, a religion originating from Japan, and Zen Buddhism.

    <p>There are a number of ther things this code teaches which teach not just Martial arts, but the way of life as well. Martial arts include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>kendo (剣道), a modern version of Kenjutsu (剣術):
        <li>Iaidō (居合道), a Japanese Martial art focused on being prepared to fight at a moment's notice, and has four main components: 
          <ol>
            <li>the controled, smooth drawing the sword from its scabbard</li>
            <li>cutting or striking the opponent</li>
            <li>shaking the blood off of the blade</li>
            <li>and replacing the sword back in its scabbard</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
    </li>
    </ul>

And if someone were to surrender or lose a battle and survive, the only way they could regain their honor was to commit Seppuku (切腹), also called harakiri (腹切り), which is a form of ritualistic suicide via disembowelment. </li>
      <li>Loyalty (忠義, chūgi): Unwavering devotion to one's family, country, but more importantly their lord, which is more valued than loyalty toward ones family, even if it means harm to them. </li>
      <li>Courage (勇氣, yūki): Bravery in the face of danger and adversity, not just physical but also morally. This means not just being able to percive what is right and wrong, but to act on it. </li>
