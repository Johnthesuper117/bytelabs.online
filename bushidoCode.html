    <p>Bushidō (武士道, "the way of the warrior") is the code of conduct for the samurai class and has a few variations, not to be confused with Budō (武道) or Bujutsu (武術), which are the overall teaching of Martial arts and self improvement. </p>
    <p>There are a number of ther things this code teaches which teach not just Martial arts, but the way of life as well. Martial arts include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>kendo (剣道), a modern version of Kenjutsu (剣術):
        <li>Iaidō (居合道), a Japanese Martial art focused on being prepared to fight at a moment's notice, and has four main components: 
          <ol>
            <li>the controled, smooth drawing the sword from its scabbard</li>
            <li>cutting or striking the opponent</li>
            <li>shaking the blood off of the blade</li>
            <li>and replacing the sword back in its scabbard</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the 7 virtues taught in Bushido:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Honor (名誉, meiyo): A samurai's most important virtue, encompassing personal integrity and a strong sense of duty.</li>
      <li>Loyalty (忠義, chūgi): Unwavering devotion to one's lord, family, and country.</li>
      <li>Courage (勇氣, yūki): Bravery in the face of danger and adversity, not just physical but also moral.</li>
      <li>Respect (禮, rei): Courtesy and politeness towards others, especially those of higher status.</li>
      <li>Honesty (誠, makoto): Truthfulness and integrity in all dealings.</li>
      <li>Benevolence (仁, jin): Compassion and kindness towards others.</li>
      <li>Rectitude (義, gi): Acting with justice and righteousness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Honor is one of the most valued virtue, to win is a battle and to die in battle are both honoring. And if someone were to surrender or lose a battle and survive, the only way they could regain their honor was to commit Seppuku (切腹), also called harakiri (腹切り), which is to ritualistic commit suicide via disembowelment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Loyalty towards one's lord is more valued than loyalty toward ones family, even if it means harm to them. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Courage </p>
    <br>
    <p>Respect towards elders and those in lower classes</p>
    <br>
    <p>Honesty and integrity</p>
    <br>
    <p>Benevolence</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rectitude, or justice and rightousness, is important to samurais and how they make decisions, </p>
