## Details

### Command Input Trainer

The CI Trainer will have a simple interface where users can input commands and receive feedback on their accuracy and timing. The user can choose which commands to practice (e.g., "Forward Quarter Circle", "Backward Half Circle", etc.) and enter custom commands as well. The user can also change keybinds, for movement and actions. The possible actions will include light punch, medium punch, heavy punch, light kick, medium kick, heavy kick, and special. The trainer will have a visual indicator for whether or not they successfully input the command, and it needs to have the strict timing that many fighting games have. For example, if the user is practicing a quarter circle forward motion, they would need to input the correct sequence of directional inputs (down, down-forward, forward) within a specific time window for it to be considered successful. The trainer will provide feedback on whether the command was executed correctly and how close the timing was to the optimal window.

### Clicks Per Second Tracker

The Clicks Per Second Tracker will have a simple interface where users can click a button as many times as they can within a set time limit (e.g., 10 seconds). The tracker will display the total number of clicks and the average clicks per second at the end of the session.

### Reaction Time Trainer

The Reaction Time Trainer will have a simple interface where users can test their reaction time by responding to visual or auditory stimuli. The trainer will randomly display a stimulus (e.g., a color change, a sound) and the user will need to respond as quickly as possible by clicking the screen. The trainer will measure the time it takes for the user to respond and provide feedback on their reaction time in milliseconds.

### Aim Trainer

The Aim Trainer will have a simple interface where users can practice their aiming skills by clicking on targets that appear on the screen. The trainer will randomly generate targets of different sizes and speeds, and the user will need to click on them as quickly and accurately as possible. The trainer will provide feedback on the user's accuracy and speed, and it can also track progress over time. The accuracy is measured by how close to the center of the target the user clicks, and how many targets they hit within a certain time limit. Speed is measured by how long it takes for the user to click on the target after it appears on the screen.

### Quick Time Event Trainer

The Quick Time Event Trainer will have a simple interface where users can practice their quick time event (QTE) skills by responding to prompts that appear on the screen. The trainer will randomly generate prompts (e.g., "Press X", "Press Y", "Press A") and the user will need to respond by pressing the correct button as quickly as possible. The user can choose which buttons will the trainer use. The trainer will measure the time it takes for the user to respond and provide feedback on their performance, including whether they pressed the correct button and how close their timing was to the optimal window. The trainer can also track progress over time and provide insights into areas where the user may need improvement. It also needs to have visual indicators for the prompts, such as a ring that shrinks around a circle which has the correct button highlighted, and the user needs to click the highlighted button when the ring it touching the target, to help the user anticipate when they need to respond.
