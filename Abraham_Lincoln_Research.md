Abraham Lincoln Research paper 


Early life: 
Abraham Lincoln was born in Hodgenville, Kentucky on February 2nd, 1809 and was born with no middle name. His family moved to Indiana on the edge of the frontier when he was seven years old. His mother died when he was nine years old, but before the second summer without the love of a mother, his father, Thomas Lincoln, married a widow named Sarah Bush Johnston who had three children, two daughters and one son. Even so, she loved all of her children, and Lincoln even called her his “angel mother”. She encouraged Abraham to read, though his desire to learn remains a mystery. His parents were both illiterate, and he went to school “by littles,” going a little now and then, totaling no more than one year of schooling. Even though he claimed to have no interest in learning, he somehow managed to learn how to read, write, and cipher to the rule of three. He had read only a few books like Parson Weems’s Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, and Aesop’s Fables. And had to have some familiarity with the Bible due to his mother being christian. 
Lincoln became a famous lawyer in Illinois due to his skill, fairness, and honesty and worked for several Train companies and banks. His most famous plea was for a murder, where the accuser claims to have seen an acquaintance of Abe’s kill someone in broad light of the moon, but Lincoln stated it was far too dark to see anything clearly that night. Five months before receiving his party’s nomination for President, he sketched his life:
“I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families–second families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks…. My father … removed from Kentucky to … Indiana, in my eighth year…. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up…. Of course when I came of age I did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher … but that was all.” 

Accomplishments: 
In the Lincoln and Douglas Debate, Lincoln believed in popular sovereignty, and wanted to get rid of slavery in the west. Douglas wanted federal sovereignty. Abraham Lincoln won the election in 1861 without the votes of any southerners, which is one of the reasons why the South wanted to succeed from America. His main reason for trying to stop the Confederates from succeeding is due to the fact that he believed it was his duty as president to preserve the union. Lincoln did not really want to end slavery, he wanted to send the slaves away. He called abolitionists zealots to denounce what they were doing. He supported the proposed amendment which would have made slavery in the south permanent. Abraham Lincoln invaded the south without permission from congress. Lincoln invaded the South a second time. Lincoln makes taxes go up and starts taxing income as well as starting the use of paper money. Lincoln makes a draft, where all men from ages 20-45 half to fight in the war. Lincoln suspended the right to have a free trial, to put those who oppose him in prison, including other politicians and pastors who didn’t pray for him. Lincoln had a difficult time finding capable generals for his armies. Generals like McDowell, Fremont, McClellan, Pope, McClellan again, Buell, Burnside, Rosecrans--all failed to bring Lincoln success on the battlefield. Abolitionists got Abe Lincoln to try to stop slavery. Lincoln did not free any slaves from slave states though. The emancipation proclamation was useless, all it did was say slaves in the south were free, but it did establish the goal to end slavery. On 1864, Lincoln ran again for president, though he did not believe he would win from the years of war, but during the last few months of the war his general, Ulysses S. Grant’s campaign in the war started to bear fruit which helped him significantly and in his second speech, on March 4, 1865, he said his goal after the war ended was “lasting peace among ourselves” and “Malice for none.” Abraham Lincoln led the Union to victory and brought the Confederates back into America after the Civil war. Thanks to this, slavery was abolished (though not necessarily ended until later)

Death: 
On April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated while watching a comedy play at Ford’s Theatre, by John Wilkes Booth. Booth waited until everyone was laughing at a punchline to shoot, afterwards he leapt onto the railing but Major Henry R. Rathbone, who was with Lincoln in the president’s box, grabbed his collar until Booth slashed at his wrist and fell to the ground on his knee and ran away. Lincoln died the next day and Booth was killed a few days later.
