            Hello, this is a one-man website that I use to learn and practice my coding skills, as well as emulate fun video games to play and make avialable to everyone with no ads (legally, of course). I am currently working on a few projects, including a game engine and a few emulators. I am also working on a few other projects that are not yet ready for public release. I hope you enjoy your stay here!
